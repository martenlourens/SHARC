Using the SHARC Pipeline
========================
To make constructing and training an SDR-NNP classifier for a given dataset easier I wrote a program called `SHARC_pipeline.py`.
This program strings together the different functions in the SHARC library. To use this program please first install some additional requirements by running:

``` bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For further information as to how this program works type:

``` bash
$ ./SHARC_pipeline.py --help
```
